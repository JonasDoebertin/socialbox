<h4>Testimonials</h4>
<blockquote>
	"I picked the plugin up a few days ago and was immediately impressed with its quality. While the task it performs is relatively simple, and there are numerous free plugins that can do more or less the same, SocialBox definitely stands above the crowd with it’s high quality. The widget works perfectly, is clear and easy to use, and provides a nice addition to any WordPress site. [...] If you’re looking for a new social widget, I highly recommend this one." - <a href="http://codecanyon.net/user/mordauk">Pippin Williamson (mordauk)</a> <strong>(Read the <a href="http://pippinsplugins.com/review-socialbox-social-widget-for-wordpress/">full review</a>)</strong>
